# Genetic-Painter
A short Python script that uses genetic algorithms to paint pictures.

v1 is the normal version that uses iterative triangle placement to create pictures.

v2 is a version that's been optimized for pypy. Note that there's very little time improvement so far.

v4 is a version that uses brushes instead of triangles in an effor to make the painting look more natural and organic.

v5 is a version that uses tranparent triangles instead of fully opaque ones. This version is unfinished and should not be used.
